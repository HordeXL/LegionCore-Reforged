# LegionCore - Reforged

## ❤️ Project Philosophy

This project is first and foremost a **preservation effort**. Legion 7.3.5 has disappeared from official servers, replaced by newer interpretations. 
Our ambition is straightforward : **bring this expansion back to life, keep it playable as it was on day one, and fix the design flaws left behind.**

We aren't trying to reinvent Legion — we are refining it.

## 🔧 Key Differences & Enhancements

Rather than a static copy baked with late-patch shortcuts, we implemented a **progressive gameplay experience**:

* **Progressive Progression (7.0 ➔ 7.3) :** Removal of late-game catch-up mechanisms *(exponential Artifact Power scaling, ilvl inflation, skipped content, etc.)* that ruined the sense of progression and shortened the adventure.
* **Complete System Scripting & Immersion :** Scripting missing or non-functional mechanics, polishing small visual and world details to enhance immersion, and ensuring all content is playable as close to retail accuracy as possible.
* **Rebalancing & Fixes :** Fine-tuning classes, and frustrating progression systems that Blizzard didn't have the time to address back then.
* **Quality of Life (QoL) :** Subtle ergonomic improvements and minor enrichments designed strictly within the original spirit of Legion.
