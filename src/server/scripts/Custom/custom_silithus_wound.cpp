/*
 * Silithus: The Wound - time travel (custom content)
 *
 * Zidormi, 128607, has always stood in Silithus but had neither menu nor script. The Legion
 * terrain is there too: phase_definitions swaps zone 1377 to map 1817, and since 2026_09_08_03
 * it fills VisibleMapID, without which the ground stayed the 2006 one.
 *
 * Aura 255152 means "Silithus before the world was wounded": wearing it puts you in the old zone,
 * not wearing it is the present, with the sword planted.
 *
 * It is permanent and saved, and nothing removes it on its own: a player keeps their version
 * when leaving the zone, changing map and logging back in.
 *
 * Custom.SilithusWound.Default only says whether the travel is open. At 1 Zidormi offers the one
 * missing option - the past to whoever is in the present, the way back to whoever is in the past.
 * At 0 she has nothing to say and the zone stays in the present, the sword planted as patch 7.3
 * left it.
